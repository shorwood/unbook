## Understand adapters

Adapters are the foundation of Unbook's backend-agnostic architecture. An adapter implements a standardized interface that abstracts away the differences between various note-taking and database platforms like **Notion**, **AppFlowy**, or custom backends.

- **Write once, run anywhere**: Code works identically regardless of the underlying backend
- **Switch backends easily**: Migrate between platforms without rewriting business logic
- **Create custom integrations**: Build adapters for proprietary systems or new platforms


::tip
The core data structure are heavily inspired by Notion's API, so adapters for other platforms may have limitations based on the capabilities of the underlying service. **This is subject to change as Unbook evolves.**
::

## Use a built-in adapter

Unbook provides official adapters for popular platforms. For now, only the Notion adapter is available but more are coming soon.

::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @unbook/notion
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @unbook/notion
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @unbook/notion
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @unbook/notion
```
::

## Configure an adapter

```ts [src/index.ts]
import { Workspace } from '@unbook/core'
import { Notion } from '@unbook/notion'

// Create the adapter with your Notion integration token
const adapter = new Notion({ token: process.env.NOTION_TOKEN })
const workspace = new Workspace(adapter)

// Now you can interact with Notion
const page = await workspace.getPage('your-page-id')
console.log(page.title)
```

::tip
You can obtain a Notion integration token from the [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) page. Make sure to grant the integration access to the pages and databases you want to work with.
::

## Create a custom adapter

You can easily implement your own adapter by defining a class that `implements` the `Adapter` interface from `@unbook/core`. This allows you to connect Unbook to any backend of your choice.

::code-tree{default-value="src/MyAdapter.ts"}
```ts [src/MyAdapter.ts]
import { Adapter } from '@unbook/core'

export class MyAdapter implements Adapter {

  /** Retrieve a page by its ID */
  async getPage(id: string): Promise<PageObject> {
    const response = await fetch(`/v1/${id}`)
    const data = await response.json()
    return {
      id: data.id,
      title: data.title,
      url: data.url,
      isArchived: data.is_archived,
      // other properties...
  }

  // other methods...
}
```

```ts [src/index.ts]
import { Workspace } from '@unbook/core'
import { MyAdapter } from './MyAdapter'

const myAdapter = new MyAdapter()
const workspace = new Workspace(myAdapter)

// Your adapter is now ready to use
const page = await workspace.getPage('page-id')
```
::

::note
All adapter methods must return objects that conform to Unbook's type system. Refer to the type definitions in `@unbook/core` for the exact structure of `PageObject`, `DatabaseObject`, `BlockObject`, and other types.
